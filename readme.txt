The source tree includes 8 projects which can all be compiled 
in Visual Studio .NET 2003.  The solution file (PowerSDR.sln) in 
the Source folder will compile all 8 projects and output the 
files to the bin\Debug or bin\Release folder depending on which
version is being compiled.

Note that MDAC 2.8 is required in order to compile.  This
library can be found on the Microsoft website at
